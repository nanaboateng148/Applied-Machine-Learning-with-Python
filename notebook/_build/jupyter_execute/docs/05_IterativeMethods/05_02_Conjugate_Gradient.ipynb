What is remarkable about this algorithm is that the residual at iteration $k+1$ is orthogonal not only to the previous residual but to all of them. As a vector space of dimension $n$ can only contain $n$ orthogonal vectors, we immediately conclude that the conjugate gradient method necessarily converges (remember the restriction we put on $A$ though)! The derivation of the properties of the conjugate gradient method can cause some severe headaches. However, they are beautifully explained in this elegant paper: \\cite{Shewchuk1994}. Here we only apply the algorithm to our sample problem and refer the interested reader to this paper.\n",
