    "In this notebook we have discussed implicit discretization techniques for the the one-dimensional heat equation. These are particularly useful as explicit scheme requires a time step scaling with $dx^2$. We have shown that the backward Euler and Crank-Nicolson methods are unconditionally stable for this problem. Although they require more complex arithmetical operations than explicit schemes, they result in very significant reduction in computational cost. These reductions are problem dependent because achieving enough accuracy depends on several factors. However, the discussion indicates that it is always important to explore the various algorithms when trying to solve a numerical problem and there is vast literature available to do this."
