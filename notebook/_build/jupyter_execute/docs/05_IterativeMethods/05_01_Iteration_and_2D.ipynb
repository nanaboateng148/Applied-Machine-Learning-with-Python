    "In the previous chapter we have discussed how to discretize two examples of partial differential equations: the one dimensional first order wave equation and the heat equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the heat equation, the stability criteria requires a strong restriction on the time step and implicit methods offer a significant reduction in computational cost compared to explicit methods. Their implementation is a bit more complicated in the sense that they require the inversion of a matrix. When the size of the matrix is not too large, one can rely on efficient direct solvers. However, for very large systems, matrix inversion becomes an expensive operation in terms of computational time and memory. This is especially true when solving multi-dimensional problems. Consider as an example the Poisson equation in three dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\nabla^2 p(x,y,z)= \\frac{\\partial^2 p(x,y,z)}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p(x,y,z)}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p(x,y,z)}{\\partial z^2} = b(x,y,z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the unknown function and $b$ is the right-hand side. To solve this equation using finite differences we need to introduce a three-dimensional grid. If the right-hand side term has sharp gradients, the number of grid points in each direction must be high in order to obtain an accurate solution. Say we need $1000$ points in each direction. That translates into a grid containing $1000\\times 1000\\times 1000$ grid points. We thus have $10^9$ (one billion) unknowns $p(x_i, y_k, z_l)$ in our problem. If we work in double precision, storing the solution requires approximatively $8$ Gb of memory. On modern desktop or laptop computers, this represents a significant amount of memory but it's not extravagant. If we now turn our  attention to the discretized matrix, this is a different story. As we have $10^9$ unknowns, the discretized Laplace operator in matrix form contains $10^9$ lines and $10^9$ columns for a total of $10^{18}$ entries! Allocating the memory to store such a matrix is therefore out of sight for even for the largest supercomputer available today (see the [list of world's largest supercomputers][51]). Fortunately, the matrix for the Laplace operator is *sparse* (see notebook `03_02_HigherOrderDerivative_and_Functions`). If we store only the non-zero elements of the matrix, the memory needed is drastically reduced. Even though direct solvers may take advantage of this, they are still pushed to their limits.\n",

    "To solve the equation numerically, we first need to introduce a 2D grid to hold our unknowns. It is a set of grid points, at which we evaluate all physical quantities. For simplicity we work with a uniform gird and the coordinates of our grid points are therefore:\n",

Here we choose to order all grid points in *column-major order*. The first components of our vector are then $p_{1,1}, p_{2,1},\\ldots, p_{nx-2,1}$. The list then goes on with $p_{1,2}, p_{2,2},\\ldots, p_{nx-2,2}$ and so on until we reach the last components $p_{1,ny-2}, p_{2,ny-2},\\ldots, p_{nx-2,ny-2}$.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have shown how to define a cartesian grid for solving two-dimensional partial differential equations using the finite difference discretization. The strategy can easily be extended to three-dimensional problems. When they require matrix inversions, higher-dimensional problems rapidly make direct inversion methods very inefficient if not impracticable. For such cases, we have shown how iterative methods can come to the rescue. We have described in detail the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods and rapidly presented the classical theory used to analyze their stability. The implementation of some iterative methods like the Jacobi method can be done directly with `numpy` and therefore benefit from the speedup of precompiled code. Others, like the Gauss-Seidel method, require an explicit looping on the grid nodes in a given order and this can lead to very slow algorithm if the loops are performed with Python loops. To circumvent this difficulty we provide in the third notebook of this chapter several strategies to boost your Python programs. But before that, we introduce another type of iterative method in the next notebook."
